# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Installation

First you need to install the dependencies. As there are some libraries that do not meet peer dependencies restrictions, you need to install the dependencies with the `--force` flag:

```bash
npm i --force
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Tutorial (branches)

The tutorial will go through the steps of creating a React app with i18n support, and the progress will be saved in different branches:

- `01_basic-react-app`: Basic react app without internationalization (i18n) support.
